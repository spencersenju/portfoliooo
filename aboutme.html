        I’m Spencer Escandon, a teenage developer with a deep passion for coding.
        From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the world of programming, and over time, I’ve
        developed a love for creating software and solving complex problems.
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading manga, watching anime, or playing
        my guitar—these hobbies give me a creative outlet and inspire me in different ways.
        I’m also really into fashion and love exploring new styles that reflect my personality.
        Whether I’m working on a new project, jamming on my guitar, or picking out an outfit,
        I’m always looking to express myself and grow in everything I do.
